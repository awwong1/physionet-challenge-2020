Sampling frequency (125 frames/sec) will be unchanged
Specify the name of the directory in which the output
 signals should be written, or press <return> to write
 them in the current directory: Any of these output formats may be used:
    8   8-bit first differences
   16   16-bit two's complement amplitudes (LSB first)
   61   16-bit two's complement amplitudes (MSB first)
   80   8-bit offset binary amplitudes
  160   16-bit offset binary amplitudes
  212   2 12-bit amplitudes bit-packed in 3 bytes
  310   3 10-bit amplitudes bit-packed in 15 LS bits of each of 2 words
  311   3 10-bit amplitudes bit-packed in 30 LS bits of 4 bytes
   24   24-bit two's complement amplitudes (LSB first)
   32   32-bit two's complement amplitudes (LSB first)
